# `@moldea.ai/cli`

The canonical read-only local command-line composition for deterministic inspection of `moldea` repositories.

The current unpublished `0.0.1` foundation provides the `moldea` executable, strict version 1 command and option parsing, deterministic help and version output, resource-limit validation, safe human or JSON errors, and Git-owned working-tree discovery for `validate` and `inspect`. Repository inventory, Repository FS construction, Core execution, adapter composition, and compatibility reporting are not implemented yet.

Tarball and installed-bin checks are the release boundary for now. This package is not ready to publish to npm.

## Commands

The version 1 command names are:

```text
moldea validate
moldea inspect
moldea compatibility
```

The foundation fully supports top-level and command-specific help, `moldea --version`, strict option validation, and usage failures. It does not inspect a repository or return successful command results yet.

## Package boundary

The package exposes the `moldea` executable and no supported JavaScript or TypeScript import API. Its exact first-class dependencies are:

- `@moldea.ai/repository`
- `@moldea.ai/repository-fs`
- `@moldea.ai/core`

No package-backed runtime adapter is active yet. The `custom` adapter remains built into Core and requires no separate package.

The executable performs no network requests, telemetry, repository writes, filesystem-reader construction, or Core inspection in this foundation. `validate` and `inspect` use read-only Git operations to discover and verify a working tree; help, version, usage failures, and `compatibility` do not invoke Git.

## Runtime support

The version 1 consumer runtime range is:

```text
^22.11.0 || ^24.11.0
```

The package is Node.js-specific. `validate` and `inspect` require Git `2.30.0` or later; commands compare the numeric Git version and accept standard platform or vendor suffixes.

## Git working-tree discovery

The starting directory is the invocation directory unless `--repository <path>` selects another path. Relative selections resolve against the invocation directory. Git determines the absolute top-level working-tree root, so ordinary repositories, unborn repositories, nested starting directories, and linked worktrees share the same discovery path.

Git runs directly without a platform shell, with fixed non-interactive arguments and a sanitized deterministic environment. Version output is limited to 4096 bytes per stream, and each discovery output stream is limited to 262144 bytes. Discovery requires Git `2.30.0` or later and rejects missing or inaccessible paths, nonrepositories, bare repositories, Git-directory paths without a usable work tree, malformed Git output, and sparse checkouts before repository inventory begins.

The CLI does not expose selected paths, resolved repository roots, raw process errors, or Git diagnostics in failures. These states use stable `git:*` human errors or the corresponding version 1 JSON error envelope. A successfully discovered supported nonsparse working tree currently reaches the safe `INTERNAL_ERROR` placeholder because repository inventory and command result composition belong to the next implementation slices.

## Development

From the monorepo root:

```bash
pnpm --filter @moldea.ai/cli typecheck
pnpm --filter @moldea.ai/cli build
pnpm --filter @moldea.ai/cli test:unit
pnpm --filter @moldea.ai/cli test:integration
pnpm --filter @moldea.ai/cli test
```

Unit and integration tests are colocated with their owning modules. Integration tests install real package tarballs and execute the resulting package bin without requiring any `@moldea.ai/*` package to be published.
